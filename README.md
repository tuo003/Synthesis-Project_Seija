Isotherm analysis

Mentor - Ryan Farquharson

Soil Potassium is one of the three major nutrients required by plants. We can measure soil potassium potential, or the soil's ability to supply potassium to the plants, by measuring equilibrium cations and calcuating isotherms. 

Workflow

1. Set up data management plan and submit to Confluence/Data_School/Projects/Synthesis by cob Friday 14/06/2019. 
2. Find cation analysis files, sort them into order and wrangle data into acceptable form. 
3. Set up Git Hub for Synthesis Project
4. Clone Git Hub on my computer
5. Data Visualisation
    -Plot cations per core, by site (crest, mid-slope, lower-slope) and by solution added. Take a look at the shapes.
6. Calculate Ionic Strength of all solutions
7. Calculate activity coefficients of all ionnic species.
