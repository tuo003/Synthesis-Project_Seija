Isotherm analysis

Soil Potassium is one of the three major nutrients required by plants. We can measure soil potassium potential, or the soil's ability to supply potassium to the plants, by measuring equilibrium cations and calcuating isotherms. 

Workflow

1. Find cation analysis files, sort them into order and wrangle data into acceptable form. 
2.
